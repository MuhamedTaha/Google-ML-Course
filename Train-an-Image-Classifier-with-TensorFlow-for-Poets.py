'''
-TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library an it's 
specially useful to work with a branch of machine learning 
called deep learning
-Here deep learing technique is used to extract data automatically from images
-We will be using transfer learning, which means we are starting with a model 
that has been already trained on another problem. We will then retrain 
it on a similar problem.Deep learning from 
scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.
